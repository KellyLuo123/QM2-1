The income data is packaged as a .csv file. The Pandas package knows how to handle this and put the data in a DataFrame, as we've seen. Let's examine the data and start to see what we can say about it. First of all, we have to find data - I'm interested in looking in data with a wide spread, so I looked for data on income in the UK. \n","\n","This data is collected by the Office for National Statistics(ONS) : http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/datasets-and-tables/index.html?pageSize=50&sortBy=none&sortDirection=none&newquery=income+percentile - but the exact data I want to see, income by percentile, is tricky to find. \n","\n","I ended up using data from 2011, generated from a study called the Family Resources Survey and collated and tweaked by an independent research unit called the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS). The \"tweaking\" they do tends to be around the size of the family unit, and other factors which create economies of scale - hence they \"equivalise\" it. The IFS is quoted in UK Government documents, so we can have some trust in their impartiality, or at least accuracy - of course, if we were publishing research about this, that's not really good enough and we'd want to reproduce, or at least understand and critique, their methodology rather than just trusting it!\n","\n","e.g.:\n","\n","http://www.ifs.org.uk/wheredoyoufitin/about.php\n","\n","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalisation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MsF6sfaWOgk7"},"source":["## Downloading the Data\n","\n","Let's grab our income data from our course website and save it into our data folder.
